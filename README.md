# Frost Met Wrapper
Neither frost.met.no nor frost-beta.met.no provide interpolated data yet for measurements. This wrapper thus provides simple functions to approximate measurements in areas based on the data they currently do provide. (When it is done at least)

There will eventually be some options to this.

## Build
Needs libcurl.
